# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Align the end of .rodata to a 4-byte boundary. With this the sections that
  will go into Flash memory will be 4 byte aligned at the start and at the
  end. Which seems to be required (?) by Cortex-M0 devices.

- .bss and .data are now padded so their sizes are multiple of 4 bytes. This
  improves the output of `objdump`; before, the output showed "Address
  0x20000004 is out of bounds".

- Linking now aborts if any of the input files contains a .got section. Dynamic
  relocations are not supported and Rust code is not relocatable by default.
  This error only occurs if C code that was compiled with the -fPIC flag is
  linked in. The error message will tell the user how to compile their C code
  without -fPIC.

## [v0.3.3] - 2017-07-14

### Changed

- Updated the documentation: it's no longer necessary to use the
  compiler-builtins repository since that crate landed in rust-lang/rust and
  it's now available in the `rust-src` component.

## [v0.3.2] - 2017-07-07

### Changed

- Tweaked documentation

## [v0.3.1] - 2017-07-07

### Fixed

- A warning when compiling for x86_64 and the "abort-on-panic" feature is
  enabled.

## [v0.3.0] - 2017-07-07

### Added

- A `default_handler!` macro to override the default exception handler.

- An `exception!` macro to override the handler for a particular exception.

### Changed

- The FPU will now be enabled before `main` if the target has FPU support.

- [breaking-change] the features "panic-over-itm" and "panic-over-semihosting"
  has been removed. the `panic_fmt` language item is now *not* included by
  default. An opt-in feature named "abort-on-panic" can be enabled to make this
  crate provide a `panic_fmt` implementation that simply aborts.

- [breaking-change] The sections `.rodata.{exceptions,interrupts}` have been
  renamed to `.vector_table.{exceptions,interrupts}`. This break the old
  mechanism for registering exceptions (`static EXCEPTIONS`); use the new ones:
  `default_handler!` and `exception!`.

- The `_stack_start` is now optional in the `memory.x` file. If unspecified its
  value will be set to `ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM)`.

## [v0.2.4] - 2017-06-03

### Added

- A non-allocatable `.stlog` section to support the [`stlog`] logging framework.

[`stlog`]: https://crates.io/crates/stlog

## [v0.2.3] - 2017-05-30

### Added

- A `_stext` symbol which can be specified in the linker script to customize the
  location of the `.text` section. If not specified the `.text` section will be
  placed right after the `.vector_table` section.

## [v0.2.2] - 2017-05-27

### Added

- A `_sheap` symbol where the heap can be located.

### Changed

- The linker sections have renamed / reorder to make `arm-none-eabi-size -A`
  more useful. You'll now see something like this:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-size -A hello
hello  :
section                size        addr
.vector_table          1024   134217728
.text                   288   134218752
.rodata                  14   134219040
```

- `cortex-m-rt::reset_handler` is now the entry point of all programs that link
  to `cortex-m-rt`. This makes GDB's `load` command work correctly. It will now
  set the Program Counter to `reset_handler` after flashing the program so
  there's no need to reset the microcontroller after flashing.

- Renamed `__exceptions` and `__interrupts` symbols, which are only used
  internally, to `_eexceptions` and `_einterrupts` respectively for consistency.

### Fixed

- Include input `.text` and `.rodata` sections (note: no suffix as in
  `.text.foo`) in the output file. (C) Code compiled without the equivalent
  `-ffunction-sections` / `-fdata-sections` may place stuff in those unsuffixed
  sections.

## [v0.2.1] - 2017-05-07

### Fixed

- Do not load the `.debug_gdb_script` section in flash. It's only needed for
  debugging.

## [v0.2.0] - 2017-04-27

### Changed

- [breaking-change] the `_stack_start` symbol is now required and must be
  provided in the `memory.x` file when using the "linker-script" feature. This
  symbol indicates where in memory the call stack will be allocated.

## [v0.1.3] - 2017-04-25

### Fixed

- A `rustdoc` warning

## [v0.1.2] - 2017-04-22

### Changed

- Unclutter the `reset_handler` function for a better debugging experience.

## [v0.1.1] - 2017-04-15

### Changed

- Improved linker error messages

## v0.1.0 - 2017-04-12
